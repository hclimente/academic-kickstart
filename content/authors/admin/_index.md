# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a postdoctoral researcher the [High-Dimensional Statistical Modeling Team](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/highdim_stat_model/), led by [Makoto Yamada](https://riken-yamada.github.io/). I am interested in bridging the gap between advancements in computer science, most prominently machine learning, and research in biology. In particular, but not exclusively,the [missing heritability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_heritability_problem) of complex diseases, that is, the discordance between the genetic causes of a phenotype, and the small number of genetic factors we can actually associate with it. Complex diseases like familial breast cancer or Alzheimer's disease are studied through [genome-wide association studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study). In my research, I explore how to incorporate prior knowledge into machine learning algorithms to boost discovery and improve the stability of the solution. The objective is to recover actionable biomarkers, which are useful for diagnosis, treatment, and to better understand the biology of the disease.
