I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [High-Dimensional Statistical Modeling Team](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/highdim_stat_model/), led by [Makoto Yamada](https://riken-yamada.github.io/).

My goal is to find genetic predictors of disease that are useful for diagnosis, treatment, and understanding the disease's biology. Traditionally, complex diseases like Alzheimer's disease are studied through genome-wide association studies ([GWAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study)). However, conventional GWAS have failed to find a significant share of those genetic causes. I am interested in closing this gap by researching machine learning methods that extract more information from GWAS. Specifically, I superimpose GWAS information onto [biological networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_network). Then, I explore such networks considering both the statistical association of each genetic factor - obtained from GWAS - and the biological context - obained from the network. However, there are many open questions about how to do this, for instance:

- How to exactly integrate GWAS information with networks?
- What is the right strategy to find truly associated genetic factors? Which underlying assumtions are justified?
- What sources of information should we consider when building those networks?
- What is the suitable resolution? The SNP? The gene? The pathway?

My hybrid education in machine learning and statistical genetics put me in a priviledged position to tackle such questions
