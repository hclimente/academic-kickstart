I was supervised by [Chlo√©-Agathe Azencott](http://cazencott.info/).

  In my thesis, [Network-guided genome-wide association studies](https://www.theses.fr/en/2020PSLEM001), I explore existing machine learning algorithms, and develop novel procedures, to better understand the genetics of cancer susceptibility. All those methods leverage on prior biological knowledge, modeled as a graph, to boost discovery.
