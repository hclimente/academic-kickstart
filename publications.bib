	abstract = {The speed at which new genomes are being sequenced highlights the need for genome-wide methods capable of predicting protein–DNA interactions. Here, we present PADA1, a generic algorithm that accurately models structural complexes and predicts the DNA-binding regions of resolved protein structures. PADA1 relies on a library of protein and doublestranded DNA fragment pairs obtained from a training set of 2103 DNA–protein complexes. It includes a fast statistical force ﬁeld computed from atom-atom distances, to evaluate and ﬁlter the 3D docking models. Using published benchmark validation sets and 212 DNA–protein structures published after 2016 we predicted the DNA-binding regions with an RMSD of {\textless}1.8 A˚ per residue in {\textgreater}95\% of the cases. We show that the quality of the docked templates is compatible with FoldX protein design tool suite to identify the crystallized DNA molecule sequence as the most energetically favorable in 80\% of the cases. We highlighted the biological potential of PADA1 by reconstituting DNA and protein conformational changes upon protein mutagenesis of a meganuclease and its variants, and by predicting DNA-binding regions and nucleotide sequences in proteins crystallized without DNA. These results opens up new perspectives for the engineering of DNA–protein interfaces.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing changes are frequently observed in cancer and are starting to be recognized as important signatures for tumor progression and therapy. However, their functional impact and relevance to tumorigenesis remain mostly unknown. We carried out a systematic analysis to characterize the potential functional consequences of alternative splicing changes in thousands of tumor samples. This analysis revealed that a subset of alternative splicing changes affect protein domain families that are frequently mutated in tumors and potentially disrupt protein-protein interactions in cancerrelated pathways. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the number of these alternative splicing changes in a sample and the number of somatic mutations in drivers. We propose that a subset of the alternative splicing changes observed in tumors may represent independent oncogenic processes that could be relevant to explain the functional transformations in cancer, and some of them could potentially be considered alternative splicing drivers (AS drivers).},

Furthermore, they complicate the interpretation of ﬁndings with wide-spread relevance. Here, we take the example of statistical epistasis networks derived from genome-wide association studies with single nucleotide polymorphisms as nodes. Even though we are only dealing with a single data type, the epistasis detection problem suﬀers from many pitfalls, such as the wide variety of analytic tools to detect them, each highlighting diﬀerent aspects of epistasis and exhibiting diﬀerent properties in maintaining false positive control. To reconcile diﬀerent network views to the same problem, we considered 3 network aggregation methods and discussed their performance in the context of epistasis network aggregation. We furthermore applied a latent class method as best performer to real-life data on inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) and highlighted its beneﬁts to increase our understanding about IBD underlying genetic architectures.},

            Network approaches to disease use biological networks, which model functional relationships between the molecules in a cell, to generate hypotheses about the genetics of complex diseases. Several among them jointly consider gene scores, representing the association between each gene and the disease, and the biological context of each gene, modeled by a network. Here, we study six such network methods using gene scores from GENESIS, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on French women with non-BRCA familial breast cancer. We provide a critical comparison of these six methods, discussing the impact of their mathematical formulation and parameters. Using a biological network yields more compelling results than standard GWAS analyses. Indeed, we find significant overlaps between our solutions and the genes identified in the largest GWAS on breast cancer susceptibility. We further propose to combine these solutions into a consensus network, which brings further insights. The consensus network contains
            COPS5
            , a gene related to multiple hallmarks of cancer, and 14 of its neighbors. The main drawback of network methods is that they are not robust to small perturbations in their inputs. Therefore, we propose a stable consensus solution, formed by the most consistently selected genes in multiple subsamples of the data. In GENESIS, it is composed of 68 genes, enriched in known breast cancer susceptibility genes (
            BLM, CASP8, CASP10, DNAJC1, FGFR2, MRPS30
            , and
            SLC4A7
            , P-value = 3 × 10
            4
            ) and occupying more central positions in the network than most genes. The network is organized around
            CUL3

            Author summary
            
              Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) scan thousands of genomes to identify variants associated with a complex trait. Over the last 15 years, GWAS have advanced our understanding of the genetics of complex diseases, and in particular of hereditary cancers. However, they have led to an apparent paradox: the more we perform such studies, the more it seems that the entire genome is involved in every disease. The omnigenic model offers an appealing explanation: only a limited number of
              core
              genes are directly involved in the disease, but gene functions are deeply interrelated, and so many other genes can alter the function of the core genes. These interrelations are often modeled as networks, and multiple algorithms have been proposed to use these networks to identify the subset of core genes involved in a specific trait. This study applies and compares six such network methods on GENESIS, a GWAS dataset for familial breast cancer in the French population. Combining these approaches allows us to identify potentially novel breast cancer susceptibility genes and provides a mechanistic explanation for their role in the development of the disease. We provide ready-to-use implementations of all the examined methods.},

The recent advances in machine learning can be attributed to deep neural networks (DNNs), which excel in various tasks in terms of computer vision and natural language processing. However, standard DNNs are not appropriate for high-dimensional datasets generated in biology because they have many parameters, which in turn require many samples. In this paper, we propose a DNN-based, nonlinear feature selection method, called the feature selection network (FsNet), for high-dimensional and small number of sample data. Specifically, FsNet comprises a selection layer that selects features and a reconstruction layer that stabilizes the training. Because a large number of parameters in the selection and reconstruction layers can easily result in overfitting under a limited number of samples, we use two tiny networks to predict the large, virtual weight matrices of the selection and reconstruction layers. Experimental results on several real-world, high-dimensional biological datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

            Systems biology shows that genes related to the same phenotype are often functionally related. We can take advantage of this to discover new genes that affect a phenotype. However, the natural unit of analysis in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is not the gene, but the single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP. We introduce
            martini
            , an R package to build SNP co-function networks and use them to conduct GWAS. In SNP networks, two SNPs are connected if there is evidence they jointly contribute to the same biological function. By leveraging such information in GWAS, we search SNPs that are not only strongly associated with a phenotype, but also functionally related. This, in turn, boosts discovery and interpretability.
            Martini
            builds such networks using three sources of information: genomic position, gene annotations, and gene-gene interactions. The resulting SNP networks involve hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges, making their exploration computationally intensive.
            Martini
            implements two network-guided biomarker discovery algorithms based on graph cuts that can handle such large networks: SConES and SigMod. They both seek a small subset of SNPs with high association scores with the phenotype of interest and densely interconnected in the network. Both algorithms use parameters that control the relative importance of the SNPs’ association scores, the number of SNPs selected, and their interconnection.
            Martini
            includes a cross-validation procedure to set these parameters automatically. Lastly,

Most of the popular selection procedures, however, require assumptions on the underlying data - such as distributional ones -, which barely agree with empirical observations. Therefore, feature selection based on nonlinear methods, such as the model-free HSIC-Lasso, is a more relevant approach. In order to ensure valid inference among the chosen features, the selection procedure must be accounted for. In this paper, we propose selective inference with HSIC-Lasso using the framework of truncated Gaussians together with the polyhedral lemma. Based on these theoretical foundations, we develop an algorithm allowing for low computational costs and the treatment of the hyper-parameter selection issue. The relevance of our method is illustrated using artiﬁcial and real-world datasets. In particular, our empirical ﬁndings emphasise that type-I error control at the considered level can be achieved.},

          Detecting epistatic interactions at the gene level is essential to understanding the biological mechanisms of complex diseases. Unfortunately, genome-wide interaction association studies (GWAIS) involve many statistical challenges that make such detection hard. We propose a multi-step protocol for epistasis detection along the edges of a gene-gene co-function network. Such an approach reduces the number of tests performed and provides interpretable interactions, while keeping type I error controlled. Yet, mapping gene-interactions into testable SNP-interaction hypotheses, as well as computing gene pair association scores from SNP pair ones, is not trivial. Here we compare three SNP-gene mappings (positional overlap, eQTL and proximity in 3D structure) and used the adaptive truncated product method to compute gene pair scores. This method is non-parametric, does not require a known null distribution, and is fast to compute. We apply multiple variants of this protocol to a GWAS inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dataset. Different configurations produced different results, highlighting that various mechanisms are implicated in IBD, while at the same time, results overlapped with known disease biology. Importantly, the proposed pipeline also differs from a conventional approach were no network is used, showing the potential for additional discoveries when prior biological knowledge is incorporated into epistasis detection.},
